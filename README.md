# agileuml
This repository contains the source files for the Eclipse Agile UML project
These are the core source files of the Agile UML toolset. 
Plugins, such as the UML to C and UML to Python translators are available as uml2Ca.zip, uml2Cb.zip and uml2py.zip, as are libraries in libraries*.zip and code generators in cg*.zip

Program translation between Java and Python, C and JavaScript is supported by translators.zip

The executable for the toolset is in umlrsds.jar

This can be executed as java -jar umlrsds.jar on the command line
The toolset expects a directory called 'output' to exist in its execution directory, 
'output' is used to hold all input and output files, such as metamodels and models.

To build the executable, run the following from the command line:

```bash
jar cvfm umlrsds.jar Manifest.txt *.class
```
then run umlrsds.jar from the command line like so:

```bash
chmod +x umlrsds.jar # needed on Unix/Unix-like systems to make the JAR file executable
java -jar umlrsds.jar
```

Further information, and a manual for the toolset, can be found in the file umlrsds20.pdf and at https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/uml2web/

Videos on the use of the toolset can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmhEP7QYIHH9MhyEjho_tdQ/
